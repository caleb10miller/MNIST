# MNIST Dataset Model Development

This is my first attempt at using TensorFlow. I chose to analyze the MNIST Dataset as a beginner project.

## Description

This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to analyzing and processing the MNIST dataset. It includes steps for data loading, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

Python 3.x <br>
MNIST dataset <br>
Libraries: tensorflow <br>

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

## Usage Instructions

Ensure all required libraries are installed. <br>
Run each cell in sequence to avoid runtime errors. <br>
Modify hyperparameters or model architecture as needed for experimentation. <br>

## Contents

Cell 1: Import Libraries <br>
Cell 2: Data loading and test/train split <br>
Cell 3: Model definition and layering <br>
Cell 4 - 5: Model prediction on subset of data and conversion to probabilities <br>
Cell 6: Define loss function for training <br>
Cell 7 - 8: Model Configuration and Compilation <br>
Cell 9: Model fitting <br>
Cell 10: Model evaluation <br>
Cell 11 - 12: Build a model that provides probabiliities <br>
